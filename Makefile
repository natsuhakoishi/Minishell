# May the Buddha grant us peace, forever free from bugs,
# May the heavens bless our code, never crashing in the slugs.
# In a tower where we write, in the chambers where we dwell,
# Programmers craft their codes, trading skill for wine as well.

# Sober, we dwell in the vast online space,
# Drunk, we find our solace, in sleep's warm embrace.
# Day upon day, in cycles we spin,
# Year after year, as the digital dance begins.

# O, to fade within the glow of the screen's soft light,
# Rather than bow before a masterâ€™s might.
# While the wealthy ride in luxury's fine array,
# We humble coders travel by bus each day.

# They mock my madness, a folly that I bear,
# Yet I laugh at my fate, finding humor in despair.
# I see not the beauties that grace the bustling street,
# For who among them would a programmer greet?
#     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
